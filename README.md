# library

The goal of this project is to make a library.
you should be able to add and remove books.
when you add a book there should popup a form.
i should use OOPS.

AAR:

i learned how to work with objects even tho i feel like i could use objects for more things but im not sure how to implement them.
dialog was a new thing i learned it seems to be very usefull it's way better than using prompts.
i chose not to spent to much time on styling this time.
